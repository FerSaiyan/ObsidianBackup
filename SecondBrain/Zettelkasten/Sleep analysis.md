- I slept for about 15 hours, and during the day I had eye dryness, felt my hole body weak after lunch, and still felt sleepy when studying. I conclude that even when you get many hours of sleep, this symptoms can occur, so I will not worry so much if I experience them when sleeping less hours. The eye dryness may be associated with the face mask, in this particular case
- There are occasions when I can sleep sitting on a chair, but when I tried it yesterday's night, I felt the want to sleep in bed stronger. I have a proposal for today: Practice meditation until I get very, very sleepy, and them I will concentrate in to sleeping at the chair and inducing a lucid dream
- I think practicing meditation can be very helpful, to learn my mental states, how to control thoughts, emotions, achieve a state of euphoria and great contentment, and to learn how to manage my awareness states. Also, it may help me to induce lucid dreams easier

- So, I have been trying to lucid dream on my bed, but its just not working and it has never worked before, except for one or two occasions.
- I have also tried to sleep sitting straight, but the urge to sleep laying overcomes me
- I decided that I will do differently. I will sleep on my table, sitting, since I've done that a lot and I know it works. I will sleep less hours and I will have naps during the day, which I may try to lucid dream. Let's see if it works!

* I have been performing a few tests with sleep. I've seen that my main difficulty is to maintain the pose and entering that state. There are some questions that I have to answer: Can I enter that state while having something to support my pose, or is the need to maintain the pose what helps me trigger that state?, What are the techniques of thought that will maximize my possibilities on entering that state?, How can I endure the urge to sleep laying down in a more effective way?
