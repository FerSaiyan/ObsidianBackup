- I need a system to help me save images in my palace. Im afraid that if I were to use the same images, it would be harder to memorize the formulas, as they would mix up with one another
- I heard of a system were they convert numbers in to letters and them they use the letters to create an imagery. But my equations have numbers and letters 
- I read an interesting tutorial, which refreshed some of my ideas about the method and also gave me a new system
1. Choose a location for a subject
2. Choose ten loci for each room
3. At each loci create a story to link four spaces for memorization
4. Repeat the memory palace in your mind with a certain frequency
