- My last arguments for being a vegetarian were that they were the only food available to me at the moment in my house (which was true) and that it was the only way for me to get the nutrition I needed without buying other food, since I don't have an income
- Now, I eat everyday at the university and most of the days, the vegetarian option is also vegan, which is great. But I still have a final debate if I will become completely vegan.
- Wow! I just searched again for vegan arguments against dairy products and I remembered how awful it is. Wow! Almost no words whatsoever.
- The main arguments are that cows younglins are separated from their mothers since birth, that their offspring are killed or sentenced to a life their parents and don't get the nutrition their nature has made them need, cows are force impregnated, pregnancy isn't something pleasing or good for the cow, the calcium in the milk often comes from the cows bones, just like with chickens.
- I will keep myself familiarized with the vegan arguments,  just so that I don't forget them
- I will also join the vegan subreddit

- I have also been taking B-12 vitamins since they are very important
