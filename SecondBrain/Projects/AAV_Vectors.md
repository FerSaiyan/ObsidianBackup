## Description:
The use of AAV viruses in order to do CRISPR, gene therapy, or expression of desired proteins.
## Considerations:
AAV viruses are replication deficient, so they won't spread crazily in the host, which is a very important thing.
## Steps:
1. Create a plasmid to be replicated in the bacteria.
	1. The plasmid must contain the ITRs (inverted terminal repeats), origin of replication, promoter region, genes of interest, WPRE and Poly-A to help expression of the gene.
