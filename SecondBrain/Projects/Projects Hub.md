Fazer um computador que opera com algo diferente do que bits (0 e 1). Poderia ser com luz por exemplo, mas tem que ser feito protocolos de segurança entre outros. E talvez ainda outros tipo de harddrives. Eu posso usar as diferentes propriedades das ondas eletromagnéticas, como polaridade e intensidade. Ou poderia fazer isso com corrente elétrica mesmo, mas o problema seria fazer a corrente caminhar para trás.

Realizar um estudo se a polarização muito grande de objetos pode ocasionar na separação de partículas virtuais e sa isso pode ser considerado uma nova forma de radiação. Preciso estudar corpos celestes carregados e como são as interações entre partículas. Magnetic monopoles could be under a sub category of this???
.
Posso tentar entender se é possível criar uma ferramenta matemática para atualizar um fator que já foi multiplicado. Tipo atualizar as probabilidades que já foram multiplicadas, mas sem multiplicar novamente. Talvez isso possa se tornar uma nova ferramenta matemática útil na mecânica quântica ou no cálculo probabilístico que envolva muitos fatores a serem multiplicados, pois você poderia calcular um padrão (que você já sabe) e realizar um cálculo mais simples com as correções.

.
Perhaps I can explain the big bang without a singularity, just providing the way for an imbalance of creation and anihilation of particles to have occured until it met a thresshold that made it expand. I thought about two possible ways that it could have came about: First, somehow all the energy got packed up and reached the threshold and expanded, or the universe is adding matter as it grows
.
Can the missing antimatter have decayed into energy, such that it didn't eliminate normal manter?
.
Is there a way to isolate antimatter such that it doesn't annihilate
.
Work on an equation to describe what conditions would be necessary to accumulate matter prior to the big bang and how could it have triggered the big bang. An application and also a test to confirm the hypothesis would be to create matter and smaller quantities and make them expand, possibly to harvest energy too. I think that there will be certain geometries that will allow for the accumulation of matter and energy
.
15/5/22
Perhaps you can find a way to manipulate the wave function of atoms or other particles such that with a certain probability, they become something else, even something that you may have intended it to become. That may be useful in the creation of rare materials, such as those used for fusion

Develop a virus for mosquitoes that creates a vulnerability in them such that it may be exploited later on. Care needs to be taken in order to ensure that mosquitoes can reproduce and spread the virus to their offspring
.
Figure out a way to evidentiate genetic mutations in cells and how to image them. It would be preferential to use molecules that are based on molecules that the body already accepts. Perhaps a protein that changes it's folding and, as a result, it would change it's signature in the detector
.
3/8/22
Use a solution similar to OrganEx to try to revive cryo frozen rats or other animals
.
Get youthful population of stem cells and implant in older rats to see if they become more youthful. If it works, we could just store our stem cells and use them latter. That would be awesome and would be easier than using a virus to induce cells backwards, but here is also another advantage which is that it would combat lack of diversity in stem cells population. I wanna research all this! 😍

Maxwell's demon using a ionic gas and a charged membrane in the middle of the junction between two boxes such that the part of the gas with enough kinetic energy (temperature) may pass to the other side while the part with less kinetic energy may stay in the other side since it cannot pass the barrier. One question is it one particle had the energy to pass, wouldn't it pass back again? Can I use the light room the increase the probability of a hot particle being on one side rather than the other?
.
Lift cargo in to space with balloons
.
Generate energy from artificial waves made in rivers as a more eco-friendly approach instead of hydroelectric plants that cause enormous areas to be submerged. The plan is to use a modified version of the equipment used by a startup that generates energy from waves while being on the surface of the sea. The plan would be to create small waves on the river and capture them with the equipment 
.

Genetically modify a strain of bacteria that thrives in our armpits such that it may stop producing that smell and may compete with the other bacterias such that they become the main strain. This would reduce the smell significantly and would allow people to spend less money on deodorants
.
I can write an article about the multiverse hypothesis: The Multiverse is composed of infinite universes; It is possible for one universe to interact with another universe; We are receiving all types of interactions from beings from other universes at every instant. I have to setup an AI model to help me write the article and I have to start sketching it
.
How can the energy be conserved in the case that for example a charged particle is shot towards a magnetic field perpendicular to it such that the particle experiences a force against it's movement, but then the particle overcomes the potential? Or how can we say that energy is being conserved when a satellite is accelerated because of the gravity of a planet? Where does that extra energy come from?
.
13/8/22
I saw that when you add two numbers together on a computer, entropy rises because you cannot determine later on which numbers were added. Perhaps I can rework the whole concept of entropy

Genetic edit stem cells so that they replace the normal cells in time, which also lowers the chances of an off-shot edit. This genetic editing could help patients that need bone marrow transplants, because they could have their own stem cells fixed through CRISPR
.
Analyze the different explanations for gravity and see if they imply a common principle between them. Check if that's consistent or not. Perhaps I can even publish a paper about it one day

Develop a better way to induce blood vessel formation like a mini heart and cells that form blood vessels
.
Make mouse embryos without a brain, but through changes in their DNA so that no one can say that they would become a life
.
Learn about the mechanism responsible for ejaculation, so that when a men reaches orgasm, he doesn't ejaculate. Maybe I can make a drug so that men may reach orgasm, bot ejaculate and skip the refractory period. It would be interesting to research about how ejaculation happens during sleep even without physical stimulation. Perhaps inhibition of the motor neurons involved in semen expulsion could also be a way to investigate what happens exactly to cause the refractory period

14/9/22
I can edit just the stem cells so that the entire organism is changed after some time. That could become one article and I could use some tools to track which cells were effectively descendant of modified stem cells
.
Perhaps stimulating the reward sector of the brain through deep brain stimulation can increase happiness
.
19/9/22
I can represent or approximate different equations and relations to find links, similarities and even to see if they are a specific case of one another. That could be useful to unite physics theories
