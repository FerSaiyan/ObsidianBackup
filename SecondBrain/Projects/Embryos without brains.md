# Embryos without brains
## Description:
This project is about developing embryos that don't posses a brain, because of ethical concerns about killing lives and about what constitutes a living being. 
The strategy is to change the DNA such that their brains will naturally not develop (and perhaps that could be used as an abortion method too, since it would prevent the child from developing a brain). But it could also be achieved by chemically preventing the development of the brain too.
