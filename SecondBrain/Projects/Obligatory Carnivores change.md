# Changing the DNA  of an obligatory carnivore to herbivore (Plant-Based)
## Description:
This project is about changing the DNA  of an obligatory carnivore to a herbivore since feeding obligatory carnivores is often more expensive and even brutal.
The first phase would likely be the engineering of the DNA first and then making a successful two individuals and also breeding.
Perhaps live editing would be interesting too.
